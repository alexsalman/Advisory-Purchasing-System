Advisory Purchasing System

My project is looking for establishing a web-based software that can help people, commercial firms, private companies, and advertising ones to choose and have knowledge about what is suitable for them in purchasing and selling different common needs. Usually, the level of people’s income makes their choices in how they spend and invest their money; however, these choices may not fit their ages, genders and income. For that reason, people and companies need to have others’ opinions in the same merchandises they like, intend to buy, or sell. The mechanism that the project follows is collecting users’ choices of the things they like and store them in different categories according to the items they choose. After a user makes his/her choices, the software will advice the user to buy specific items based on his/her choices and other people’s choices that already have been saved in a database. The advisory will be made based on different characteristics like the user’s age, gender, salary, item of choices, and the choices of other users, who share common characteristics. In that way, the system will provide adequate suggestions that can ease the user’s decision of buying items.
